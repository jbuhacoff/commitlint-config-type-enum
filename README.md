# commitlint-config-type-enum

My preferred list of types for use with commitlint.

Each type is either a verb in its bare infinitive form or a singular noun.

Based on [config-angular-type-enum](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/blob/master/@commitlint/config-angular-type-enum/index.js)
with the following changes:

* replaced `feat` with `add`
* replaced `docs` with `doc`
* added `improve`
